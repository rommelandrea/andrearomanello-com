Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share more about myself with you.

Having been in software engineering for more than a decade, I have had the opportunity to work on an array of projects across many different digital products. Through this experience, I have learned a great deal; the importance of studying and researching new ideas, as well as the benefit of continuously innovating and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Additionally, taking the time to fully understand the project and its associated business objectives is critical to achieving success. Over the years, I have also come to understand that taking calculated risks and thinking outside the box can be incredibly rewarding. My journey in software engineering has been invaluable and I am still committed to learning, growing, and striving for excellence.

I am confident in my ability to work with micro-service environments, leveraging Cloud services, containers, and Kubernetes. I am also experienced in developing and deploying applications on the cloud, including AWS and Azure. I am proficient in several programming languages, such as Javascript and PHP. My experience with DevOps processes and tools helps me to deliver applications quickly and efficiently.
